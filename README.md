**Bash-Lib** is a library of common [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) routines used in projects based on the [a-bash-template (BaT)](https://github.com/richbl/a-bash-template) project. This library is broken into two files:

 - `General`: Routines created to check program and file dependencies, banner display, *etc*.
 - `Args`: Routines created to manage command-line argument parsing
